# landing-page

This is rudimentary, but the way to proceed on from here is clear.

```
The HeroSection will need tweaking, might try justify-content: center
For all the divs inside the sections, they will need a width to give spacing on both sides. 
Get better graphics for prinny stats
For QuoteSection, the speaker would probably be given align-text: right
```

Overall, I think there is much to be improved, but this is good enough.

Other things to work on is writing README.md with proper formatting and cleaner DOM management
